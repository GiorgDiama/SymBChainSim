If you need to implement your own protocol you can follow the instruction in X.py - It is recomended to copy PBFT and modify it into your new protocol - this way all necessary methods are there.

To use/test/debug your CPs:
1. Import the CP class into manager.py
2. Add the CP in the the CPs dictionary as (X.NAME: X)
3. Change "CP" in base.yaml into X

Running the simulation after the above will attempt to initliase the nodes using the class you have added to the dictionary

If sucessfull, you can enable debugging to go step-by-step over the events generated by your protocol and observe how the CP'state is updated
